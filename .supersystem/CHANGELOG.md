## 2026-09-09 — Phase 1 Core Contracts

### Added
- Git repository initialized (branch `main`); Phase 0 baseline commit `103b043`.
- `src/core/` package (Python 3, stdlib only — ADR-001):
  - `enums.py` — frozen value sets (PermissionMode, EffortLevel, TaskState, RiskLevel, SideEffect, Reversibility, Idempotency, PolicyDecisionValue, CompletionDecisionValue per ADR-002, VerificationStatus, SideEffectState, ActionStatus, ActorType, ModelRole, ApprovalDecision, IndependenceLevel, TargetType).
  - `contracts.py` — Task, SuccessCriterion, CompletionContract, PolicyContext, TargetAuthorizationContext, ResourceLimits, Plan, Decision, FailureRecord, VerificationState, Checkpoint, ContinuityState, ActionRequest, PolicyRequest, PolicyDecision, ApprovalRequest, ApprovalResult, Tool, ToolResult, Evidence, VerificationResult, CompletionDecision, Error, Target, ActorIdentity; strict deterministic JSON (de)serialization — unknown fields, missing required fields, and invalid enum values fail closed.
  - `validation.py` — lifecycle transition table (TASK_SCHEMA.md s22), DONE restricted to the Completion Engine path, schema validation (s36), execution gate (s33), target-authorization expiry (s19).
  - `versions.py` — frozen document versions.
- `tests/unit/` — 57 tests: enum contract, lifecycle transitions, task schema and execution gate, contract serialization. All pass on Termux (Python 3.14.6) and Windows (Python 3.14.3).

### Changed
- ROADMAP.md: Phase 1 status NEXT → COMPLETE; Phase 2 (Task Manager) → NEXT.

### Notes
- REQUIREMENTS.md, OBSERVABILITY.md, research/*.md remain empty placeholders: not prerequisites for Phase 1 (audit 2026-09-09).
- Cross-document CompletionDecision discrepancy recorded in ADR-002.
- T-INV-01..25 test IDs referenced by TASK_SCHEMA.md s37 are not yet enumerated anywhere — to be defined in the adversarial-test phase.
